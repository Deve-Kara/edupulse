## 🏗 Technical Architecture & Standards

EduPulse is built following the **Clean Code** philosophy and industry-standard React patterns:

1.  **Optimized Rendering:** Heavily utilizes `useCallback` and `useMemo` to ensure that data-heavy charts do not cause performance bottlenecks.
2.  **Hook Stability:** Strict adherence to the `exhaustive-deps` ESLint rules to prevent memory leaks and unpredictable side effects.
3.  **Data Modeling:** MongoDB schemas are optimized for "Chart-Ready" data delivery, reducing the need for expensive frontend transformations.
4.  **Responsive Design:** A mobile-first approach using Material UI’s grid system for administrative access on any device.
